The corrected CSS would address the issues by ensuring that all values used within the `calc()` function are correctly defined and that units are consistently applied. For percentage-based calculations, it may be necessary to use `vw` or `vh` instead of percentages to ensure that the result is consistent across different screen sizes.  Compatibility issues may require using fallbacks for older browsers or employing CSS preprocessors that provide tools for better cross-browser compatibility.  For example, the problematic `margin: calc(10% - 10px);` could be rewritten (with possible fallbacks) to handle potential negative margins and improve cross-browser compatibility. A more robust solution might involve using JavaScript to dynamically calculate the margin based on the parent element's width or employing a different approach to achieve the same visual layout.
