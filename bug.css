The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations on different CSS values. However, it can sometimes lead to unexpected results if the calculation is not written carefully. For example, if you try to calculate a percentage based on a value that is not yet defined, it may not work as expected. Another common mistake is to forget to include units in the calculation, which can result in unexpected behavior. In some browsers, there may also be compatibility issues with different versions of CSS, or with the usage of certain units like `rem` or `vw` inside a calculation.  Consider a scenario where you're trying to set a margin using `calc()`: `margin: calc(10% - 10px);`. If the parent element's width is too small, the negative margin might cause unexpected layout issues.  Furthermore, combining different units, such as `px` and `%`, may require careful attention to ensure accurate calculations across different screen sizes.
